# About
Provus SASS Starter Kit

## Compiling using a Docker container
- SSH into the docker container
- Go to the root of this theme (web/themes/custom/provus_bootstrap)
- Run 'npm install'
- Run 'npm install gulp --global'
- Run 'gulp'
- Alternately run 'gulp build_watch' to run 

Notes 
The 'build_wath' argument will compile the css and start a watch so that when
you change a file, it will rebuild. If you don't use this argument, 
it defaults to not watch.
